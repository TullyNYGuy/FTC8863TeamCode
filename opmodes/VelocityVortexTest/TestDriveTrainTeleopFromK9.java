/**
 * This OpMode uses the common HardwareK9bot class to define the devices on the robot.
 * All device access is managed through the HardwareK9bot class. (See this class for device names)
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * This particular OpMode executes a basic Tank Drive Teleop for the K9 bot
 * It raises and lowers the arm using the Gampad Y and A buttons respectively.
 * It also opens and closes the claw slowly using the X and B buttons.
 *
 * Note: the configuration of the servos is such that
 * as the arm servo approaches 0, the arm position moves up (away from the floor).
 * Also, as the claw servo approaches 0, the claw opens up (drops the game element).
 *
 * Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
